# End-to-End Healthcare Analytics with SQL & Power BI

This project showcases a complete end-to-end healthcare analytics solution — from synthetic data generation to interactive dashboards. It demonstrates the integration of Python, SQL, and Power BI to extract actionable insights from complex healthcare data.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Data Generation:** Synthetic healthcare dataset created using Python with Faker, mimicking real-world complexity across patients, doctors, appointments, diagnoses, prescriptions, and billing.

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** SQL was used to clean messy fields, remove inconsistencies (e.g., nulls, invalid dates, negative billing amounts), and engineer insights like patient activity, appointment trends, and financial KPIs.

- **Power BI Reporting:** The cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI, where calculated columns and DAX measures were added. Three interactive dashboards highlight patient and appoitment overview, financial performance, and clinical insights.
